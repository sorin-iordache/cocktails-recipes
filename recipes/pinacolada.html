    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Pina Colada is a tropical classic that has been satisfying vacationers and Tiki aficionados since the 1950s. Despite its reputation as a blender-heavy drink, the Pina Colada has a rich history and a place in the sun.</p>
    <p>Legend has it that Ramon “Monchito” Marrero, the head barman at the Caribe Hilton in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, first mixed this delightful concoction in 1954. Craft-focused bartenders have reclaimed the original recipe, emphasizing solid ingredients and proper proportions. The result? A sweet yet balanced cocktail that transports you to a sunny beach with every sip</p>
