    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h1>Mojito</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days.</p>
    <p>Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!</p>

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rum</li>
        <p>Always use white rum for mojitos. Avoid spiced rums, because these will take away from the freshness of the mint and lime.</p>
        <li>Mint</li>
        <p>Spearmint is most commonly used for mojitos and is what you'll likely find at the grocery store labeled generically as "mint." For an authentic Cuban mojito, use mojito mint, or <em>Mentha x villosa</em>, a type of mint native to Cuba with a more understated flavor than that of spearmin</p>
        <li>Lime</li>
        <p>Use freshly squeezed limes for best flavor. When shopping for limes, look for fruits with smooth skin, as this indicates the fruit is full of juice.</p>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <p>Folks often substitute simple syrup for sugar in mojitos because it blends into the drink more smoothly. However, classic mojito recipes call for granulated sugar</p>
        <li>Club Soda</li>
        <p>Top everything off with club soda to lighten up the drink and balance out the other ingredients.</p>
    </ul>
