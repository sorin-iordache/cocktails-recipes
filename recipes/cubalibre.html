    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Cuba Libre, meaning “Free Cuba,” is one of the most popular Cuban cocktails in existence, along with the classic Daiquiri and the Mojito.</p>
    <p> While the combination of rum, Coke and lime may seem simple, within those three ingredients lies a synergy that has pleased palates for over a century. </p>

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rum</li>
        <p>Typically, a Cuban-style light rum is used in the Cuba Libre. It’s the base spirit for this cocktail and provides the necessary alcoholic kick.</p>
        <li>Lime</li>
        <p>Freshly squeezed lime juice is essential for an authentic Cuba Libre. It adds a zingy twist to the classic rum and cola combination, cutting through the sweetness of the cola.</p>
        <li>Cola</li>
        <p>The cola component is what gives the Cuba Libre its signature flavor. While Coca-Cola is the traditional choice, you can use any cola brand you prefer.</p>
    </ul>
